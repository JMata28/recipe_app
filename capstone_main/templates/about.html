<h1>About Dish Data</h1>
<p> It is very common for people, especially for young adults, to look up recipes on the internet. A simple Google search can quickly find hundreds or thousands of recipes for most popular dishes. However, there are multiple websites where people share and find recipes, which is good for variety, but also can present some downsides. For example, every website has their own formatting to present recipes, with some including long blog- like pages where the user must dig deep to find the information they are looking for. In addition, users may like recipes from different websites, so keeping track of them can be difficult. This Recipe Web Application addresses some of those issues by serving as a social media-type platform where users can create an account, share, rate, save, and look up recipes in a single platform.</p>
